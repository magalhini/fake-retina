Fake Retina
===========

Simulates the appearance of retina displays in the browser.


1) Copy the bookmarklet.js code into a new bookmark.
2) Use it as a toggle between retina/non/retina.

## Issues

- Only tested in Webkit. Firefox doesn't allow the devicePixelRatio to be changed directly.
- Does NOT pull in retina media queries automatically.
