Fake Retina
===========

Simulates the appearance of retina displays in the browser.


Copy the bookmarklet.js code into a new bookmark and use it as a toggle between retina/non-retina.

## Issues

- Only tested in Webkit. Firefox doesn't allow the devicePixelRatio to be changed directly.
- Does NOT pull in retina media queries automatically.
